## Description 

Food is something that universally brings everyone together, so we thought it would be a great idea to bring together two different ways one could go about getting food. Preparing it at home with recipes, or going out to restaurants.

## User Story

```
AS A User
I WANT to see a Food Search Website with options to get food from restaurants or the recipe to prepare it at home.
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN a Food Website with select inputs.
WHEN I search for the food of my choice by selecting the options Restaurants.
THEN I am presented with 15 nearby restaurants in a table format with Restaurant Name, price and Rating.
WHEN I search for the food of my choice by selecting the options Recipes.
THEN I am presented with the Recipe name, no:of servings and ingredients.
